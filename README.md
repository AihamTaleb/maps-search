# maps-search

This project enables the user to create a transportation network as a directed graph and then query this network.
The two main types of queries include:

1. Shortest path query: which calculates the shortest path between two stations and the total time required to travel from the source station to the destination station.

2. Nearby stations query: which gives a list of nearby stations from a given station within a certain travelling time limit.
